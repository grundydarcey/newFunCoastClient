            <p>
                Fun Coast Tours serves the greater Daytona Beach Area. Our goal is to deliver the very best tours of every type to entertain both visitors and locals alike. Our Segway tours were our very first offering but we didn’t stop there; we will not stop innovating until we have a tour that appeals to everyone a tour at almost any price point.<br />
                If you have ever wanted to ride a Segway, take a look at the tours we have to offer; we think you will find something you like. Regular Segways can carry a maximum of 260 pounds but ours can support riders up to 330 pounds! We have even hosted tours with riders up to 370 pounds! Don’t make the mistake of thinking that you can’t enjoy our tours, if you want to enjoy Daytona Beach in a way you’ve only imagined, we will find a way to get you up on two wheels with the wind in your hair.<br />
                Our Segways are designed with wider tires and are meant for off-road and beach riding. We take every opportunity to take you out on the sand whenever possible, we know you come to Daytona for the beach. Take a look at the tour offerings below, once you decide how we can show you your good time, schedule your ride at the bottom of the page!

                “The Beach Run” -This is less of a tour and more of a chance to get out and enjoy a Segway ride while enjoying Daytona’s greatest assets: the sun and the sand. The Beach Run is a 60-minute ride after the 15-minute safety training, it is also our most affordable ride @ $45.  Your guide will be along just to ensure your safety and steer your group away from areas where riding is prohibited.

                “The Haunted History Tour”- You may not think of ghosts when you think of Daytona Beach, if you did then you wouldn’t need us. Don’t expect to lose any sleep after this guided tour, we mostly lead it as the sun is about to set and not in full dark.  We feel that in the dark, Segways are possibly more dangerous than the spirits.  Since your safety is our main goal, we do not operate after dark but most of our local “departed” don’t wait for the sun to set before they begin to prowl. This tour, after the 15-minute safety training, is a 90-minute ride that covers not only local history but also highlights some of the most notorious and haunting tales that Daytona Beach has to offer for $65.  For $5 more we also offer a weekend tour before 5pm that includes a tour of Lilian Place, the mansion home of the oldest ghost story on the Daytona beachside.  We will have to tell you the ghost story outside because they will not let us discuss it inside the walls…

                “Ride  & Seek” - This tour is so new we haven’t opened it for bookings yet, but keep an eye out for it to appear on the calendar.  For $90, you will use our proprietary app that takes your team of intelligence operatives and a guide through the Daytona Beach Historic District, hunting for clues to find an agent that has gone missing while investigating apparent occultists.  If you are up to the task, each clue will guide your team to the next and you will ultimately be led to the location the agent was last heard from.  You will venture inside, leaving your Segways behind and attempt to escape with your lives, and hopefully the information you came for in the first place!  This tour can last 2 hours after the 15-minute safety training and combines a Segway ride, a scavenger hunt, and an escape room for an afternoon of fun and adventure.
